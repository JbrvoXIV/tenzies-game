# Tenzies Game 
### Created with React and SCSS

My first React project making use of:
* useState
* useEffect
* useRef
* localStorage

Tenzies is a game where you have to "collect" all 10 dice of the same value as quickly as possible.

In this version of Tenzies, the amount of rolls, your current timer and a personal best timer are displayed so you can keep track of your statistics.
